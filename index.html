<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I was born in Western Australia to an Australian mother and German father.  I am 43 years old, have been married since I was twenty and have lived in Canberra most of my life.  I have two surly teenagers, two cats and a dog.  </p>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p>I enlisted as a Signaller in the Australian Army Reserves when I was 17 and completed one of the last Morse code courses run by the Army School of Signals.  Through my Reserves experience, I later fell into a career in the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC) and worked my way up through a variety of corporate and operational roles to the executive level. </p>

<p>I resigned from Commonwealth employment in October 2020 and have since worked as the Business/Operations Manager for a local company that sources highly skilled Information Technology (IT) workers for contracting roles within the AIC.  The transition from working within a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) to working remotely was mind-blowing, particularly being able to work comfortably on the couch in my active wear with freely given administrative access to the latest cloud-based technologies.  </p>

<h3>Education and IT experience</h3>
<p>I have a Year 12 Certificate and have completed a range of private industry certifications in Project Management.  I have also completed several short courses over the years including HTML, Tableau, Visual Basic, MobileIron for example.  I am a skilled Excel user and taught myself macros to automate repetitive tasks, such as consolidating data. </p>
<h4 style="color:FireBrick;"> Interesting Fact: &nbsp My mother changed my name without my knowledge as a child.  This led to me finding out my marriage was not legal, and I could not obtain a passport in my early twenties.  Apparently, this is not an uncommon event!</h4>

<h2>Why IT? </h2>
<p> My interest in IT started when my mother purchased our first computer, an Osborne 386SX.  I was thrilled with uncovering access to GORILLAS.BAS through the command prompt.  I have owned just about every console on offer and am still to this day fascinated with Pokémon Go and Animal Crossing.  I am an old nerd.</p>
<p> Early in my career, I was transferred into a remediation role with the Department of Defence to help address audit findings surrounding leave and payroll administration.  I had the relevant systems (user) experience and understood the data, so was sent to Oracle query reporting training.  I then learned how to interrogate multiple payroll systems to pull sample data for audit and internal controls testing.  This article provides some background to my first major remediation job – supporting the auditors appointed by Parliament:   <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-02/angry-fitzgibbon-sends-auditors-in-over-sas-pay/1605686">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-02/angry-fitzgibbon-sends-auditors-in-over-sas-pay/1605686 </a> (Rodgers, E 2009, ‘Angry Fitzgibbon sends auditors in over SAS pay bungle’, ABC News, 02 March, viewed 12 June 2022, <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-02/angry-fitzgibbon-sends-auditors-in-over-sas-pay/1605686>).</p>

<h2> Why RMIT? </h2>
<p> I have enrolled in RMIT through Open Universities Australia as I want to study flexibly.   I have also heard that RMIT has an excellent reputation.  I have always wanted to obtain a tertiary qualification and have chosen IT simply to improve my own knowledge.  I am studying for myself and have no current plans to launch an IT career, though I will likely continue with some casual consultancy work and implement what I learn along the way.  I want to better understand the fundamentals of IT – from building computers to networks and programming.  I am an experienced user but don’t understand how the magic happens in the backend.  I also want to gain an understanding of the amazing tools available today.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this task, I have chosen to launch my second career as a Software Developer.  The company I worked for most recently allowed me to develop my own procedures and to streamline their business processes.  For example, I developed a JIRA board to track employee onboarding tasks.  Employee onboarding and many of the company’s processes were previously managed using multiple spreadsheets.  I enjoy this type of work as I love finding solutions to problems.</p>
